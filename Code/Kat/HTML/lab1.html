        <p> In 1970, the Welsh illustrator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Steadman">Ralph Steadman</a> landed in Louisville to cover the Kentucky Derby for Scanlan’s Monthly, and was picked up by Hunter S Thompson in a red convertible. The rest, you could say, is history.
        <br></br>
        As well as writing and illustrating his own books and Thompson's, Steadman has worked with writers including Ted Hughes, Adrian Mitchell and Brian Patten, and also illustrated editions of Alice in Wonderland, Treasure Island, Animal Farm, the English translation of Flann O'Brien's Gaelic-language classic The Poor Mouth, and most recently, Fahrenheit 451.
        <br></br>
        In an interview with the <i>Guardian</i>, Steadman stated “I prefer Nixon to Trump. I think anybody would because Nixon was at least a politician. A proper or improper one, doesn’t matter. Trump just isn’t, Trump is a lout. He’s a godawful disgrace to humanity, really.”
        <br></br>
        <blockquote> "Trump is a lout. He’s a godawful disgrace to humanity, really." </blockquote>
        <br></br>
        In his book <i>Between the Eyes</i>, Steadman wrote about the need for optimism. “We live in a time when the world needs a powerful injection of hope and personal achievement,” he said. “Nothing cynical will serve our purpose now.”
        <br></br>
        Steadman studied art in London, then began publishing cartoons in Private Eye magazine during the “satire boom” of the 1960s. He has continued his career as a political cartoonist since then and has won several awards. He's not known to shy away from his political opinions and has been the center of controversy over the years.  He was born in 1936 and lives in England with his wife. </p>
