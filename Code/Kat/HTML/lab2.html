              <h2>Beatitudes Visuales Mexicanas</h2>
              <h3>By Lawrence Ferlinghetti</br>1975</h3>
              <p>Autobus on Paseo de la Reforma with destination signs: bellas artes insurgentes. Exactamente. Just what’s needed: Insurgent Arts. Poesía Insurgente. This is not it ...</p>

              <p>1
              Bus to Veracruz via Puebla + Xalapa ... Adobe house by highway, with no roof and one wall, covered with words: la luz del mundo.</p>

              <p>2
              Passing through Puebla late Sunday afternoon. A band concert in a plaza next to a Ferris wheel — I have passed through many places like this, I have seen the toy trains in many amusement parks. When you’ve seen them all you’ve seen One</p>

              <p>3
              Halfway to Xalapa a great white volcano snow peak looms up above the hot altiplano — White god haunting Indian dreams.</p>

              <p>4
              A boy and three burros run across a stubble field, away from the white mountain. He holds a stick. There is no other way.</p>

              <p>5
              Deep yellow flowers in the dusk by the road, beds of them stretching away into darkness. A moon the same color comes up.</p>

              <p>6
              As the bus turns + turns down the winding hill, moon swings wildly from side to side. It has had too many pathetic phallusies written about it to stand still for one more.</p>

              <p>7
              In Xalapa I am a head taller than anyone else in town — A foot of flesh and two languages separate us.</p>

              <p>8
              At a stand in the park at the center of Xalapa I eat white corn on the cob with a stick in the end, sprinkled with salt, butter, grated cheese + hot sauce. The dark stone Indian who hands it to me has been standing there three thousand years.</p>

              <p>9
              I’m taking this trip from Mexico City to the Gulf of Mexico and back without any bag or person — only what I can carry in my pockets. The need for baggage is a form of insecurity.</p>

              <p>10
              Two hours in this town and I feel I might live forever (foreign places affect me that way). The tall church tower tolls its antique sign: pray.</p>

              <p>11
              In early morning in the great garden of Xalapa, with its terraces and immense jacaranda trees, pines + palms, there are black birds with cries like bells, and others with hollow wooden voices like gourds knocked together. The great white volcano shimmers far off, unreached by the rising sun.</p>

              <p>12
              Brown men in white palmetto cowboy hats stand about the fountains in groups of three or four, their voices lost to the hollow-sounding birds. Along a sunlit white stone balustrade, student lovers are studying each other, novios awaiting the day. The sun beats down hot and melts not the mountain.</p>

              <p>13
              On the bus again to Veracruz, dropping down fast to flat coast. A tropical feeling — suddenly coffee plantation + palms — everything small except the landscape, horses the size of burros, small black avocados, small strong men with machetes — each still saying to himself Me llamo yo.</p>

                <h2>Buddhist New Year Song</h2>
                <h3>By Diane di Prima</br>1990</h3>
                <pre>
                  I saw you in green velvet, wide full sleeves
                  seated in front of a fireplace, our house
                  made somehow more gracious, and you said
                  “There are stars in your hair”— it was truth I
                  brought down with me

                  to this sullen and dingy place that we must make golden
                  make precious and mythical somehow, it is our nature,
                  and it is truth, that we came here, I told you,
                  from other planets
                  where we were lords, we were sent here,
                  for some purpose

                  the golden mask I had seen before, that fitted
                  so beautifully over your face, did not return
                  nor did that face of a bull you had acquired
                  amid northern peoples, nomads, the Gobi desert

                  I did not see those tents again, nor the wagons
                  infinitely slow on the infinitely windy plains,
                  so cold, every star in the sky was a different color
                  the sky itself a tangled tapestry, glowing
                  but almost, I could see the planet from which we had come

                  I could not remember (then) what our purpose was
                  but remembered the name Mahakala, in the dawn

                  in the dawn confronted Shiva, the cold light
                  revealed the “mindborn” worlds, as simply that,
                  I watched them propagated, flowing out,
                  or, more simply, one mirror reflecting another.
                  then broke the mirrors, you were no longer in sight
                  nor any purpose, stared at this new blackness
                  the mindborn worlds fled, and the mind turned off:

                  a madness, or a beginning?

                <h2>Dream: The Night of December 23rd</h2>
                <h3>By Michael McClure</br>2011</h3>
                <pre>
                              for Jane ﻿

                —ALL  HUGE LIKE GIANT FLIGHTLESS KIWIS TWICE THE
                                                      SIZE OF OSTRICHES,
                                          they turned and walked away from us
                                 and you were there Jane and you were twenty-two
                                        but this was the nineteen-forties,
                                   in Wichita, near the edge of town, in a field
                                  surrounded by a copse of cottonwoods. It was
                                    getting dark and the trees around the bridge
                                       almost glowed like a scene by Palmer.
                           The two Giant Birds—Aepyorni—from Madagascar,
                               extincted A.D. one thousand, turned and walked
                           from us across the bridge. Even in the semi-darkness
                                   the softness of their brown feathers made
                                 curls pliant as a young mother’s hair. There
                         was a sweet submission in the power of their enormous
                                  legs (giant drumsticks). Their tiny heads
                                  (in proportion to their bodies) were bent
                          utterly submerged in their business and sweeping
                         side to side as a salmon does—or as a wolf does—
                             but with a Pleistocene, self-involved gentleness
                                beyond our ken. My heart rose in my chest
                                    (as the metaphysical poets say “with
                                   purple wings of joy.”) to see them back
                              in life again. We both looked, holding hands,
                                     and I felt your wide-eyed drinking-in

                of things.
                                Then I turned and viewed across the darkening
                             field and there was a huge flightless hunting fowl
                                  (the kind that ate mammals in the Pliocene).
                          He stood on one leg in the setting sun by the sparkling
                               stream that cut across the meadow to the bridge.

                            He had a hammer head and curled beak, and after my
                                 initial surge of fear to see the field was dotted,
                            populated, by his brethren, each standing in the setting

                                        sun, I saw their stately nobility
                                          and again

                the self-involvement.

                                                   We followed the Aepyorni

                                      across the old wooden bridge made of huge
                                timbers. The bridge was dark from the shadows
                                     of the poplars and the evergreens there.
                               The stream was dimpled with flashing moonlight

                                        —and I think it had a little song.

                                                    Then

                              I found that on the bridge we were among
                              a herd of black Wildebeests—Black Gnus.
                           One was two feet away—turned toward me—
                                looking me eye-into-eye. There was primal
                                    wildness in the upstanding coarse (not
                                        sleek as it really is in Africa) fur on
                                the knobby, powerful-like-buffalo shoulders.
                                 (Remember this is a dream.) I passed by him
                           both afraid and unafraid of wildness as I had passed
                     through the herd of zebras at the top of Ngorongoro Crater
                        in front of the lodge, where from the cliff we could see
                            a herd of elephants like ants, and the soda lake
                                    looked pink because of flamingos there.
                                        There is an essence in fear overcome
                                and I overcame fright in passing those zebras

                                     and this black Wildebeest.

                                              Then we passed

                                  over the heavy bridge and down a little trail
                                  on the far side of the meadow, walking back

                                  in the direction we had been.

                                               Soon we came

                                       to a cottage of white clapboards
                          behind a big white clapboard house and knocked
                             on the door; it was answered by a young man
                  with long hair who was from the Incredible String Band.
                          He took us inside and he played an instrument
                              like a guitar and he danced as he played it.
                          The lyre-guitar was covered with square plastic
                                buttons in rows of given sizes and shapes.
                              The instrument would make any sound, play
                                 any blues, make any creature sound, play
                                             any melody…I wanted it
                                     badly—it was a joy. My chest rose.
                               I figured I’d have to, and would be glad to,
                                  give twenty or thirty thousand for it…
                                              Then the dream broke
                              and I was standing somewhere with Joanna
                                to the side of a crowd of people by a wall
                                of masonry and I reached into my mouth
                                  and took from my jaw (all the other
                        persons vanished and I was the center of everything)
                                        a piece which was eight teeth
                                      fused together. I stared at them
                               wondering how they could all be one piece.
                                They were white…It was some new fossil.
                        Down on the bone there were indentations like rivulets
                                    like the flowing patterns of little rivers.

                              Constantly risking absurdity
                                                             and death

                    performing entrechats
                                               and sleight-of-foot tricks
                and other high theatrics
                                               and all without mistaking
                                     any thing
                                               for what it may not be

                       For he's the super realist
                                                     who must perforce perceive
                                   taut truth
                                                 before the taking of each stance or step
                in his supposed advance
                                                  toward that still higher perch
                where Beauty stands and waits
                                                     with gravity
                                                                to start her death-defying leap

                      And he
                             a little charleychaplin man
                                                           who may or may not catch
                               her fair eternal form
                                                     spreadeagled in the empty air
                                  of existence

                <h2>America</h2>
                <h3>By Allen Ginsberg</br>1956</h3>
                <pre>
                America I’ve given you all and now I’m nothing.
                America two dollars and twentyseven cents January 17, 1956.
                I can’t stand my own mind.
                America when will we end the human war?
                Go fuck yourself with your atom bomb.
                I don’t feel good don’t bother me.
                I won’t write my poem till I’m in my right mind.
                America when will you be angelic?
                When will you take off your clothes?
                When will you look at yourself through the grave?
                When will you be worthy of your million Trotskyites?
                America why are your libraries full of tears?
                America when will you send your eggs to India?
                I’m sick of your insane demands.
                When can I go into the supermarket and buy what I need with my good looks?
                America after all it is you and I who are perfect not the next world.
                Your machinery is too much for me.
                You made me want to be a saint.
                There must be some other way to settle this argument.
                Burroughs is in Tangiers I don’t think he’ll come back it’s sinister.
                Are you being sinister or is this some form of practical joke?
                I’m trying to come to the point.
                I refuse to give up my obsession.
                America stop pushing I know what I’m doing.
                America the plum blossoms are falling.
                I haven’t read the newspapers for months,
                  everyday somebody goes on trial for murder.
                America I feel sentimental about the Wobblies.
                America I used to be a communist when I was a kid I’m not sorry.
                I smoke marijuana every chance I get.
                I sit in my house for days on end and stare at the roses in the closet.
                When I go to Chinatown I get drunk and never get laid.
                My mind is made up there’s going to be trouble.
                You should have seen me reading Marx.
                My psychoanalyst thinks I’m perfectly right.
                I won’t say the Lord’s Prayer.
                I have mystical visions and cosmic vibrations.
                America I still haven’t told you what you did
                  to Uncle Max after he came over from Russia.
                I’m addressing you.
                Are you going to let your emotional life be run by Time Magazine?
                I’m obsessed by Time Magazine.
                I read it every week.
                Its cover stares at me every time I slink past the corner candystore.
                I read it in the basement of the Berkeley Public Library.
                It’s always telling me about responsibility. Businessmen are serious.
                Movie producers are serious. Everybody’s serious but me.
                It occurs to me that I am America.
                I am talking to myself again.

                Asia is rising against me.
                I haven’t got a chinaman’s chance.
                I’d better consider my national resources.
                My national resources consist of two joints of
                  marijuana millions of genitals an unpublishable private literature
                  that jetplanes 1400 miles an hour and twentyfive-thousand mental institutions.
                I say nothing about my prisons nor the millions of
                  underprivileged who live in my flowerpots under the light of five hundred suns.
                I have abolished the whorehouses of France, Tangiers is the next to go.
                My ambition is to be President despite the fact that I’m a Catholic.

                America how can I write a holy litany in your silly mood?
                I will continue like Henry Ford my strophes are as
                  individual as his automobiles more so they’re all different sexes.
                America I will sell you strophes $2500 apiece $500 down on your old strophe
                America free Tom Mooney
                America save the Spanish Loyalists
                America Sacco & Vanzetti must not die
                America I am the Scottsboro boys.
                America when I was seven momma took me to Communist Cell meetings
                  they sold us garbanzos a handful per ticket a ticket costs a
                  nickel and the speeches were free everybody was angelic and
                  sentimental about the workers it was all so sincere you have
                  no idea what a good thing the party was in 1835 Scott
                  Nearing was a grand old man a real mensch Mother Bloor the
                  Silk-strikers’ Ewig-Weibliche made me cry I once saw the
                  Yiddish orator Israel Amter plain. Everybody must have been a spy.
                America you don’t really want to go to war.
                America its them bad Russians.
                Them Russians them Russians and them Chinamen. And them Russians.
                The Russia wants to eat us alive. The Russia’s power mad.
                She wants to take our cars from out our garages.
                Her wants to grab Chicago. Her needs a Red Reader’s Digest.
                Her wants our auto plants in Siberia. Him big bureaucracy running our fillingstations.
                That no good. Ugh. Him make Indians learn read.
                Him need big black n*****s. Hah. Her make us all work sixteen hours a day. Help.
                America this is quite serious.
                America this is the impression I get from looking in the television set.
                America is this correct?
                I’d better get right down to the job.
                It’s true I don’t want to join the Army or turn lathes in precision parts factories,
                I’m nearsighted and psychopathic anyway.
                America I’m putting my queer shoulder to the wheel.

                <h2>The American Way</h2>
                <h3>By Gregory Corso</br>1970</h3>

                1

                I am a great American
                I am almost nationalistic about it!
                I love America like a madness!
                But I am afraid to return to America
                I’m even afraid to go into the American Express—

                2

                They are frankensteining Christ in America
                         in their Sunday campaigns
                They are putting the fear of Christ in America
                         under their tents in their Sunday campaigns
                They are driving old ladies mad with Christ in America
                They are televising the gift of healing and the fear of hell
                         in America under their tents in their Sunday
                         campaigns
                They are leaving their tents and are bringing their Christ
                         to the stadiums of America in their Sunday
                         campaigns
                They are asking for a full house an all get out
                         for their Christ in the stadiums of America
                They are getting them in their Sunday and Saturday
                         campaigns
                They are asking them to come forward and fall on their
                         knees
                         because they are all guilty and they are coming
                         forward
                         in guilt and are falling on their knees weeping their
                         guilt
                         begging to be saved O Lord O Lord in their Monday
                         Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
                         and Sunday campaigns

                It is a time in which no man is extremely wondrous
                It is a time in which rock stupidity
                         outsteps the 5th Column as the sole enemy in America
                It is a time in which ignorance is a good Ameri-cun
                         ignorance is excused only where it is so
                         it is not so in America
                Man is not guilty   Christ is not to be feared
                I am telling you the American Way is a hideous monster
                         eating Christ   making Him into Oreos and Dr. Pepper
                         the sacrament of its foul mouth
                I am telling you the devil is impersonating Christ in America
                America’s educators & preachers are the mental-dictators
                         of false intelligence   they will not allow America
                         to be smart
                         they will only allow death to make America smart
                Educators & communicators are the lackeys of the
                         American Way
                They enslave the minds of the young
                         and the young are willing slaves (but not for long)
                         because who is to doubt the American Way
                         is not the way?
                The duty of these educators is no different
                         than the duty of a factory foreman
                Replica production   make all the young think alike
                         dress alike   believe alike   do alike
                Togetherness   this is the American Way
                The few great educators in America are weak & helpless
                They abide   and so uphold the American Way
                Wars have seen such men   they who despised things about
                         them
                         but did nothing   and they are the most dangerous
                Dangerous because their intelligence is not denied
                         and so give faith to the young
                         who rightfully believe in their intelligence
                Smoke this cigarette doctors smoke this cigarette
                         and doctors know

                Educators know   but they dare not speak their know
                The victory that is man is made sad in this fix
                Youth can only know the victory of being born
                         all else is stemmed   until death be the final victory
                         and a merciful one at that
                If America falls it will be the blame of its educators
                         preachers   communicators   alike
                America today is America’s greatest threat
                We are old when we are young
                America is always new   the world is always new
                The meaning of the world is birth not death
                Growth gone in the wrong direction
                The true direction grows ever young
                In this direction what grows grows old
                A strange mistake   a strange and sad mistake
                         for it has grown into an old thing
                         while all else around it is new
                Rockets will not make it any younger—
                And what made America decide to grow?
                I do not know   I can only hold it to the strangeness in man
                And America has grown into the American Way—
                To be young is to be ever purposeful   limitless
                To grow is to know limit   purposelessness
                Each age is a new age
                How outrageous it is that something old and sad
                         from the pre-age incorporates each new age—
                Do I say the Declaration of Independence is old?
                Yes I say what was good for 1789, is not good for 1960
                It was right and new to say all men were created equal
                         because it was a light then
                But today it is tragic to say it
                         today it should be fact—
                Man has been on earth a long time
                One would think with his mania for growth
                         he would, by now, have outgrown such things as
                         constitutions manifestos codes commandments
                         that he could well live in the world without them
                         and know instinctively how to live and be
                         —for what is being but the facility to love?
                Was not that the true goal of growth, love?
                Was not that Christ?
                But man is strange and grows where he will
                         and chalks it all up to Fate   whatever be—
                America rings with such strangeness
                It has grown into something strange and
                         the American is good example of this mad growth
                The boy man   big baby meat
                         as though the womb were turned backwards
                         giving birth to an old man
                The victory that is man does not allow man
                         to top off his empirical achievement with death
                The Aztecs did it by yanking out young hearts
                         at the height of their power
                The Americans are doing it by feeding their young to the
                         Way
                For it was not the Spaniard who killed the Aztec
                         but the Aztec who killed the Aztec
                Rome is proof   Greece is proof   all history is proof
                Victory does not allow degeneracy
                It will not be the Communists will kill America
                         no   but America itself—
                The American Way   that sad mad process
                         is not run by any one man or organization
                It is a monster born of itself   existing of its self
                The men who are employed by this monster
                         are employed unknowingly
                They reside in the higher echelons of intelligence
                They are the educators the psychiatrists the ministers
                         the writers the politicians the communicators
                         the rich the entertainment world
                And some follow and sing the Way because they sincerely
                         believe it to be good
                And some believe it holy and become minutemen in it
                Some are in it simply to be in
                And most are in it for gold
                They do not see the Way as monster
                They see it as the “Good Life”
                What is the Way?
                The Way was born out of the American Dream
                         a nightmare—
                The state of Americans today compared to the Americans
                         of the 18th century proves the nightmare—
                Not Franklin not Jefferson who speaks for America today
                         but strange red-necked men of industry
                         and the goofs of show business
                Bizarre! Frightening! The Mickey Mouse sits on the throne
                         and Hollywood has a vast supply—
                Could grammar school youth seriously look upon
                         a picture of George Washington and “Herman Borst”
                         the famous night club comedian together at Valley
                         Forge?
                Old old and decadent   gone the dignity
                         the American sun seems headed for the grave
                O that youth might raise it anew!
                The future depends solely on the young
                The future is the property of the young
                What the young know the future will know
                What they are and do the future will be and do
                What has been done must not be done again
                Will the American Way allow this?
                No.
                I see in every American Express
                         and in every army center in Europe
                         I see the same face the same sound of voice
                         the same clothes the same walk
                I see mothers & fathers
                         no difference among them
                Replicas
                They not only speak and walk and think alike
                         they have the same face!
                What did this monstrous thing?
                What regiments a people so?
                How strange is nature’s play on America
                Surely were Lincoln alive today
                         he could never be voted President   not with his
                         looks—
                Indeed Americans are babies all in the embrace
                         of Mama Way
                Did not Ike, when he visited the American Embassy in
                         Paris a year ago, say to the staff—“Everything is fine,
                         just drink Coca Cola, and everything will be all right.”
                         This is true, and is on record
                Did not American advertising call for TOGETHERNESS?
                         not orgiasticly like today’s call
                         nor as means to stem violence
                         This is true, and is on record.
                Are not the army centers in Europe ghettos?
                         They are, and O how sad   how lost!
                The PX newsstands are filled with comic books
                The army movies are always Doris Day
                What makes a people huddle so?
                Why can’t they be universal?
                Who has smalled them so?
                This is serious! I do not mock or hate this
                         I can only sense some mad vast conspiracy!
                Helplessness is all it is!
                They are caught   caught in the Way—
                And those who seek to get out of the Way
                         can not
                The Beats are good example of this
                They forsake the Way’s habits
                         and acquire for themselves their own habits
                And they become as distinct and regimented and lost
                         as the main flow
                         because the Way has many outlets
                         like a snake of many tentacles—
                There is no getting out of the Way
                The only way out is the death of the Way
                And what will kill the Way but a new consciousness
                Something great and new and wonderful must happen
                         to free man from this beast
                It is a beast we can not see or even understand
                For it be the condition of our minds
                God how close to science fiction it all seems!
                As if some power from another planet
                         incorporated itself in the minds of us all
                It could well be!
                For as I live I swear America does not seem like America
                         to me

                Americans are a great people
                I ask for some great and wondrous event
                         that will free them from the Way
                         and make them a glorious purposeful people once
                         again
                I do not know if that event is due   deserved
                         or even possible
                I can only hold that man is the victory of life
                And I hold firm to American man

                I see standing on the skin of the Way
                         America   to be as proud and victorious as St.
