      <p>During his career, he served as the first Chief of the <b class="term">US Forest Service</b>, between the years of 1905 to 1910.  In 1900, He established the <b class="term">Society of American Foresters</b>, to bring credibilty to an emerging profession.  His career with the Forest Service ended after President Taft was elected and his successor, whom he picked, redirected the Forest Service's mission to fighting forest fires with the intention of protecting the timber until it could be removed via large scale <b class="term">clearcuts</b>.  Congress and the public accepted this approach, and Gifford was made an outcast, but he made continued to follow various other pursuits and the Forest Service figured out that leaving some trees standing was important, so it all worked out.</p>
